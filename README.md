The purpose of this project was to realize a simulation of a pizzeria, which is composed of a reception that accepts new commands, of several kitchens, themselves with several cooks, themselves cooking several pizzas. 
With this project, I learnt to deal with various problems, including load balancing, process and thread synchronizationand communication.

•The first parameter is a multiplier for the cooking time of the pizzas.
•The second parameter is the number of cooks per kitchen.
•The third parameter is the time in milliseconds, used by the kitchen stock to replace ingredients.
